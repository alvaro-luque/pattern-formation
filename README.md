# pattern-formation
This repository contains several python code files for simulating the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction in both the Brusselator and Oregonator historical approaches. Some code uses deterministic algorithms to solve the PDEs of the system numerically whilst the file gillespie.py contains a stochastic approach to the problem.
