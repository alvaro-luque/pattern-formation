# pattern-formation
This repository contains several python code files for simulating the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction in both the Brusselator and Oregonator historical approaches. Some code uses deterministic algorithms to solve the PDEs of the system numerically whilst the file gillespie.py contains a stochastic approach to the problem.

Please note that these files were created for a university project, therefore this repository is intended for our teachers to check our work. The files are somewhat messy and many commented sections fulfill the purpose of being practical for quick simulations from which we want to obtain different results.
